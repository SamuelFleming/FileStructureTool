This instance, I want to generate data for my ML natural language classification model to operate in a customer request chatbot. The purpose of the model is to classify the user's response to a leading question for them to describe their issue. 

Here are some examples showing the format the data must look like:

RequestType,RequestCategory,RequestSubCategory,pattern
WASTE,MISSEDBIN,,"I noticed that my bin was not collected on the scheduled pickup day, which was Monday."
WASTE,MISSEDBIN,,"It seems like my bin was missed during the garbage collection this week on its designated day, which is Thursday."
WASTE,MISSEDBIN,,"I realized that my bin was not emptied on Tuesday, the day it was supposed to be collected."
WASTE,MISSEDBIN,,"The rubbish collectors overlooked my bin during today's collection rounds, which takes place every Friday."

I want the data to be generated in exclusively the same format as the above, the user input ("pattern") labelled with the request category (represented with the combination of "RequestType", "RequestCategory" & "RequestSubCategory"). 
It is imperative that the data be generated in standard csv format where the pattern be enclosed in a single set of double quotes, and per row that the values be comma seperated (with no spaces).

In order for you to generate data, please consider the following class and its provided description:
[set_desc]
With this, can you generate [num] more samples of the [cat] class to be included in the training set in RequestType,RequestCateory,RequestSubCategory,pattern format.
